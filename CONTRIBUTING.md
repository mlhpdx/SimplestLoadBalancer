SLB is a very simple concept, and that's reflected in the software.  Practically speaking, SLB is a single file program and that's likely how it will stay.  That said, PRs for fixes and enhancements are very much welcome.  As with reporting issues, the project doesn't provide a template for PRs - use your judgement, try to follow the (odd) coding convention and explain your goals and decisions in the description.
